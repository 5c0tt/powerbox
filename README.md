#powerBox
This was an idea to make a USB charger in a cigarette box.  The description I made in git-hub needs to be updated as there were two projects.

One was a USB 120v power outlet with ports for charging low voltage.  I wonder, does a phone line put out 5V, if it does, that is free charging on all USB devices.

I [asked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26704453/is-there-enough-voltage-on-a-phone-line-to-power-and-charge-usb-devices) on StackOverflow, we shall see what they have to say about this notion.
